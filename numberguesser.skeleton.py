# This is a guess the number game.
import random

# Set a minimum and maximum value for the possible range
# *** step one: write definition of two variables below ***


# Chooses a random number between minimum and maximum values
number = random.randint(minimum, maximum)

# Ask for user's name
# *** step two: write print statement asking name below ***


# User writes in their name, code saves input as username
# *** step two: write definition of username as input below ***


# Tells user the range of numbers to guess from
# *** step three: write print statement using maximum and minimum below ***


# Counts the number of guesses so far, starting with none
guessesTaken = 0

# *** step four: write while loop and conditional below ***


# *** delete the # when prompted ***
# print("Take a guess.")
# guess = input()
# guess = int(guess)

# guessesTaken = guessesTaken + 1

# *** step five: create two if statements when guess is too low and too high below ***

# *** step six: create two if statements when guess is correct and incorrect ***
